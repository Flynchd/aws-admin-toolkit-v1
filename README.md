## Features

- **Resource Management**: Manage AWS resources efficiently with scripts for provisioning and managing EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and IAM users.

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up effective monitoring and logging solutions using AWS CloudWatch, including enabling logs for EC2 instances, configuring alarms, and creating custom dashboards.

- **Security and Compliance**: Ensure security and compliance in your AWS environment with tools for configuring AWS Config Rules, enabling AWS CloudTrail, and implementing IAM best practices.

- **Automation and Scripting**: Automate common administrative tasks with scripts for automating EC2 instance start/stop schedules, creating EBS snapshots, and executing custom AWS CLI commands.

- **Cost Optimization**: Optimize AWS infrastructure expenses with tools for identifying and terminating idle EC2 instances, analyzing instance utilization, and automating Reserved Instance purchases for cost savings.

- **Integration and Extensibility**: Integrate the admin toolkit with AWS Lambda, AWS Step Functions, and other services to extend functionality, automate workflows, and create custom API integrations.
